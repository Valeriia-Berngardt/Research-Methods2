### Bradford protein assay
#### *Protocol*  
### (A-B) 
 1.	Take a 96-well plate
2.	Take out the standards, place on ice until completely thawed
3.	Take the standards in the solution in which the assay is performed. In this case *RIPA*.
4.	Brad solution should be diluted 1:5. So take 1 part Brad and 4 parts *DDW*. Add 200 µl to each well. Total 18 wells of standards.
5.	Then in each well add 4 µl of *BSA* and also 4 µl of test protein.
6.	Add along the wall, burst the bubbles with a needle.
7.	Place on a rocker for 5 minutes
8.	Check for homogeneity
9.	If there is any precipitate - stir with a pipette.
10.	Then place it in the machine.
11.	On the computer select protocol - procedure - absorbance 595. Save in excel format
