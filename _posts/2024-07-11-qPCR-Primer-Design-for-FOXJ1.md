# qPCR Primer Design for "FOXJ1" in Nematostella vectensis with Baclofen Treatment

## Rationale for Gene Selection
For the study of primary cilia in *Nematostella vectensis*, I decided to focus on the gene FOXJ1 (Forkhead Box J1). This gene is crucial for the development and function of motile cilia, making it an appropriate candidate to examine the effects of baclofen on primary cilia. FOXJ1 is directly involved in cilia formation and regulation. Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, could potentially affect FOXJ1 expression, leading to changes in cilia formation and function. I hypothesize that treatment with baclofen may lead to a reduction in FOXJ1 gene expression levels. Changes in FOXJ1 expression will help us understand the impact of baclofen on ciliary development or maintenance.

## Experimental Conditions
I will test two conditions:
1. Control
2. Baclofen treatment

## Reference Gene
To normalize the qPCR data, I will use the following stable housekeeping genes:
- **ACTB (Beta-Actin)**: a structural protein frequently used as a reference gene in gene expression studies.

## Primer Design
Based on guidelines, I will design qPCR primers for FOXJ1 and the reference genes using Primer3.

### FOXJ1 Primer
- Forward Primer (F): AAGCCTACCTTCCAGCAGTG
- Reverse Primer (R): GCTGGTGATGGTGAACTGGA

### ACTB Primer
- Forward Primer (F): AGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGAC
- Reverse Primer (R): AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG

## Experimental Plan
1. Extract RNA from *Nematostella vectensis* larvae treated with and without baclofen.
2. Synthesize cDNA using reverse transcription.
3. Set up qPCR reactions using the designed primers for FOXJ1 and ACTB.
4. Run qPCR and collect Ct values for each gene.
5. Analyze data using ΔCt and ΔΔCt methods to determine relative gene expression changes.
